hi, this is my pokemon battle simulator i've been working on for a hypothetical future project and to practice javascript [and CSS once i get to graphics]. it's really rough right now, mind the bumps. a bit of this is referenced from pokemon showdown's code, and you can tell, so credit where it's due i guess
always open to pointers, ideas, opinions, whatever. i'm very new to javascript and so everything might seem like a bit of a mess. currently prioritizing actually getting things implemented before i make the code look nice.
[note: i know that my object arrays would be better off as json files. i dont want to make them json files yet. json files are scary]

CURRENT PRIORITY:
- FIXING MOVES WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON

FUTURE FEATURES:
- status moves
- natures
- usable items
- catching pokemon
- more pokemon!
- abilities
- leveling system + EVs
- Endless Mode...
- graphics but i dont want to add those because CSS animations are terrifying and horrible
