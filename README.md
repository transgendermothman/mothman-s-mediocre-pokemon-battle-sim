hi, this is my pokemon battle simulator i've been working on for a hypothetical future project and to practice javascript [and CSS once i get to graphics]. it's really rough right now, mind the bumps. a bit of this is referenced from pokemon showdown's code, and you can tell, so credit where it's due i guess
always open to pointers, ideas, opinions, whatever. i'm very new to javascript and so everything might seem like a bit of a mess.

CURRENT PRIORITY:
- file cleanup/organization
- simplification
- implementing types

FUTURE FEATURES:
- status moves
- natures
- usable items
- catching pokemon
- more pokemon!
- abilities
- leveling system + EVs
- Endless Mode
